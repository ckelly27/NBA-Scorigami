# NBA-Scorigami

Scorigami is a phenomenon in sports where the final score of a game is unique in the sense that no other game has ever had that same final score. This is something that is farily well-known and documented in the NFL. Another sport that I have interest in is basketball, particularly the NBA. I have found that scorigami in the NBA isn't really something that is well-known, nor is it documented as widely as it is in the NFL. This program seeks to amend this difference between the two sports leagues.
